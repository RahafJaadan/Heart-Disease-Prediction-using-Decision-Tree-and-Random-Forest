# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest
## Overview 
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using two machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree and Random Forest. The dataset includes patient medical records such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

## Dataset 
The dataset contains 14 medical attributes, including features like:
* Age 
* Sex  
* Cholesterol
* trestbps
* oldpeak	

The target is to predict whether the patient has heart disease

## Algorithms
 * **Decision Tree**: A simple, interpretable model used for classification.
 * **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that improves accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

 ## Installation 
 1. Clone the repository.

 ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git ```

 2. Install dependencies.
   
``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage 
* Preprocess the data. 
* Train and evaluate both models.
*  Use the trained model to predict heart disease.

 ## Results
  Random Forest generally provides better accuracy than Decision Tree due to its ensemble nature.
